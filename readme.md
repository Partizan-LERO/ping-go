# GOLANG MULTITHREADING SERVER CHECKER

### A simple multithreading application for checking the availability of servers.

To run it, just use this command: 
`go run main.go`

To build: 
`go build` and the execute the given file.

By default, it uses 10 threads simultaneously. 
But you can change it by passing the `--threads` argument to the command. Like this:

`go run main.go --threads=5` - now the script will handle 5 processes simultaneously.
